Create an application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application displays three input fields for student's name, semester, and email and one button Add to add a student in a list. After adding a student, the three fields should be cleared for the entry of the next student. For each dynamically added student, the application should have a button Remove to remove the student. Add four buttons: Highlight Name, Highlight Semester, Highlight Email, and Reset. On clicking button Highlight Name, all names should be highlighted in red color; On clicking button Highlight Semester, all semesters should be highlighted in blue color; On clicking button Highlight Email, all emails should be highlighted in green color; On clicking button Reset, all three fields for all students: name, semester, and email should be reset to black color.
